# Project Status

## Overview

This document summarizes the current status of both the backend (Node.js/Express/Prisma) and frontend (React Native/Expo) for the Survey Application, including implemented features, pending work, and next steps. It is intended as a handover reference for a new team.

---

## Backend Status

### Implemented Features

- Project structure set up with Express, Prisma, and TypeScript
- Authentication implemented:
  - DTOs for login and registration (`src/dtos/authDto.ts`)
  - Controller for authentication (`src/controllers/authController.ts`)
  - Service layer for authentication logic (`src/services/authService.ts`)
  - Routes for `/auth/login` and `/auth/register` (`src/routes/authRoutes.ts`)
  - Middleware for JWT authentication and role-based access (`src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts`)
- Role-based registration rules enforced (SUPERADMIN/ADMIN can register users, one role per user)
- Prisma schema supports all user roles and relationships
- Surveyor management:
  - Assigning wards/mohallas to surveyors
  - Toggling surveyor login status
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Multiple database migrations applied

### Pending Implementation

- Some routes (e.g., survey, user) are planned but **not yet implemented** (see `app.ts` comment)
- API endpoints for dropdown data (wards/mohallas) are **not yet exposed** for frontend consumption
- Unit and integration tests for authentication and surveyor endpoints
- API documentation and backend README
- Additional validation and error handling improvements

### Recommendations / Next Steps

1. Implement missing routes (survey, user, etc.) as per project requirements
2. Expose endpoints for all dropdown data needed by the frontend
3. Add and run database seed scripts if not already done
4. Write and run automated tests (unit/integration)
5. Add API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger recommended)
6. Review and optimize error handling and validation
7. Add backend setup and usage documentation

## Frontend (my-expo-app) Status

### Implemented Features

- Project structure set up with React Native (Expo) and TypeScript
- Navigation and screen scaffolding in place:
  - Screens for Login, Register, Profile, Dashboard (for each role), Splash, etc.
  - Navigation logic in `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`
  - Layout components scaffolded (e.g., `Container`, `SideNav`)
- Service layer for API calls (`src/services/authService.ts`)
- Basic styling and assets included
- Role-based navigation and access control
- UI/UX with modern design, light/dark theme, and accessibility labels
- Auth integration: login and registration forms with validation and error handling
- Theme context with light/dark mode toggle and persistence

### Pending Implementation

- Dropdown data for wards/mohallas uses **mock data**; real API integration pending
- Profile editing UI present but **edit functionality is disabled**
- Dashboards are present but currently simple welcome screens (expand with real data/features as required)
- Unit and integration tests for screens and services
- Frontend README and user guide

### Recommendations / Next Steps

1. Integrate real API for dropdowns as soon as backend endpoints are available
2. Enable profile editing once backend supports it
3. Expand dashboards with real data and features as required
4. Write and run automated tests (unit, UI, and integration)
5. Add user documentation and app setup instructions

## General Notes

- Only SUPERADMIN and ADMIN can register users (backend enforced)
- Each user can have only one role
- Passwords are securely hashed (bcrypt) and JWT is used for authentication
- The project is ready for further feature development and integration
- Codebase is clean and modular, making it easy for new developers to onboard
- No explicit test coverage; recommend prioritizing this for stability

## Handover Checklist

- [x] Codebase is organized and modular
- [x] Core authentication and role management implemented
- [x] Main screens and navigation present in frontend
- [ ] Survey/user routes and endpoints to be completed
- [ ] Dropdowns and profile editing to be fully integrated
- [ ] Automated tests to be added
- [ ] Documentation to be written
