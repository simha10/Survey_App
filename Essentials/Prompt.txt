First things first, I want to be specific with you regarding some areas and expect the same with you to be with the cursor prompt. 

Preferred Tech-Stack - 
Frontend: React Native (Expo)
Backend: Node.js with Express
Database: Prisma ORM
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Validation: Zod
Password Hashing: bcrypt
Local Storage: React Native Async Storage

Constraints and Restrictions - 
1. Only either Surveyors or Supervisors out of the Users can do the survey part.
2. Also, there are specific fields with specific input structure as can be seen in the provided text file.
3. Options or choices for the Drop-downs need to be taken from the Master Tables that are already filled with the static data which remain same and doesn't change over the course often.

Form Design Part - 
1. There are 3 different types of surveyable properties - Residential, Non-Residential and Mix.
2. For Residential, some of the fields should not appear in form which are meant for Non-Residential and Mix Properties only and not meant for the Residential ones.
3. The form fields have been down into several parts and placed in separate tables for convenience and ease of maintenance, form too should follow the same breakage.
4. First, a page should appear right after login of Surveyor that displays 4 different clickable cards - Residential, Non-Residential, Mix and Sync Data options.
5. Then should appear a page where a button is available called Add Survey at the bottom of the screen which upon clicking opens the Survey Input Form.
6. Save Survey button at the bottom end of the form

Prompt Generation Part - 
1. Tell Cursor to follow the specified pattern as per the form specifications provided to you through the .txt file.
2. Cursor should generate the form in a such a way that, Input Field Name, Input Field should appear with no need for any Placeholders.
3. Cursor should generate a neat, clean form with provided precise fields and input types along with some clean UI.
4. Cursor has to highlight the Input Field Names to make the Surveyor not to overlook any.
5. Fields with * are mandatory fields which makes the input field to have required in the form.
6. All the Survey Fields should get stored in React Native Async Storage before being pushed to DB manually by the Surveyor.
